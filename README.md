# Rastrigin-Function-Optimization
The Rastrigin function is a popular benchmark function in optimization. It is commonly used to test the performance of optimization algorithms due to its rugged landscape and multiple local minima.

## Function Definition
The Rastrigin function is defined as:

$f(x) = A \cdot n + \sum_{{i=1}{n}} (x_i^2 - A \cdot \cos(2\pi x_i))$

Where:
- `x` is a vector of real numbers representing the solution variables.
- `n` is the dimensionality of the search space.
- `A` is a constant (usually 10).

## Characteristics
- **Non-Convexity**: The function is highly non-convex.
- **Multi-Modality**: It has multiple local minima.
- **Periodicity**: Features oscillations due to the cosine term.
