# Rastrigin-Function-Optimization
The Rastrigin function is a popular benchmark function in optimization. It is commonly used to test the performance of optimization algorithms due to its rugged landscape and multiple local minima.

## Function Definition
The Rastrigin function is defined as:

$f(x) = A \cdot n + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_i^2 - A \cdot \cos(2\pi x_i) \right)$

Where:
- `x` is a vector of real numbers representing the solution variables.
- `n` is the dimensionality of the search space.
- `A` is a constant (usually 10).

## Characteristics
- **Non-Convexity**: The function is highly non-convex.
- **Multi-Modality**: It has multiple local minima.
- **Periodicity**: Features oscillations due to the cosine term.

The global minimum of the Rastrigin function is at \( f(\mathbf{x}^*) = 0 \), where \( \mathbf{x}^* \) is the vector of solution variables that minimizes the function.

In the case of the Rastrigin function, the global minimum occurs at \( \mathbf{x}^* = \mathbf{0} \), where all components of \( \mathbf{x} \) are zero. When all components are zero, each term in the function becomes zero, leading to the minimum value of zero for the entire function.

This minimum value of zero is what optimization algorithms aim to find, as it represents the best possible solution for the Rastrigin function. However, due to its rugged landscape and multiple local minima, finding this global minimum can be challenging for optimization algorithms.
