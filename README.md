# Rastrigin-Function-Optimization

The Rastrigin function is a popular benchmark function in optimization. It is commonly used to test the performance of optimization algorithms due to its rugged landscape and multiple local minima.

## Function Definition
The Rastrigin function is defined as:

$f(x) = A \cdot n + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( x_i^2 - A \cdot \cos(2\pi x_i) \right)$

Where:
- `x` is a vector of real numbers representing the solution variables.
- `n` is the dimensionality of the search space.
- `A` is a constant (usually 10).

## Characteristics
- **Non-Convexity**: The function is highly non-convex.
- **Multi-Modality**: It has multiple local minima.
- **Periodicity**: Features oscillations due to the cosine term.

## Finding Global Minimum
In the case of the Rastrigin function, the global minimum occurs where all components of $x$ are zero. When all components are zero, each term in the function becomes zero, leading to the minimum value of zero for the entire function.

This minimum value of zero is what optimization algorithms aim to find, as it represents the best possible solution for the Rastrigin function. However, due to its rugged landscape and multiple local minima, finding this global minimum can be challenging for optimization algorithms.

# Genetic Algorithm 
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. It is commonly used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. Below, I'll explain the parameters set for a genetic algorithm:

## Genetic Algorithm Parameters
- **Population Size**: The number of individuals or candidate solutions in each generation of the genetic algorithm. A larger population size can help explore the search space more extensively but may also increase computation time.

- **Generations**: The number of iterations or generations the genetic algorithm will run. Each generation involves evaluating the fitness of individuals, selecting parents for mating, applying genetic operators (such as crossover and mutation), and producing a new population.

- **Mutation Rate**: The probability or rate at which mutation is applied to individual genes in the population. Mutation introduces diversity into the population by randomly altering the values of genes, helping the algorithm to explore new regions of the search space. A relatively low mutation rate ensures that the population doesn't diverge too quickly from promising solutions.

- **Crossover Rate**: The probability or rate at which crossover (also known as recombination or mating) is applied to pairs of individuals in the population. Crossover combines genetic material from two parent individuals to create offspring individuals, potentially inheriting favorable traits from both parents. A high crossover rate encourages exploration by combining information from multiple individuals.

- **Elitism Size**: The number of top-performing individuals (elites) from each generation that are directly copied into the next generation without undergoing genetic operators. Elitism ensures that the best solutions found so far are preserved across generations, preventing premature convergence and improving the overall performance of the genetic algorithm. A relatively high elitism size retains a larger proportion of the best-performing individuals in each generation.
